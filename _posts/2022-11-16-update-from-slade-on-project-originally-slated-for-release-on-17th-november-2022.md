title: Update from Slade on Project Originally Slated for Release on 17th November 2022
---

“I’m sorry to say that I don’t think I’ll be able to get my project out by tomorrow. It just needs a little more time to mature before I’m willing to release it into the world. You may thank the (rapidly) developing situation around it for this delay.

I am now targeting a new date of 30th November 2022. Hope to see you then.”
