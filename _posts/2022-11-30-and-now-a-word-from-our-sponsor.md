title: And now, a word from our sponsor

I've got feelings about accepting sponsorships. And since it's the holiday season, I wanted to share how I determine whether or not to take a sponsorship, or join an affiliate program, as those emails are starting to hit my inbox now...

- **Do your due diligence.** I cannot stress this one enough: A company is [not all they seem to be](https://twitter.com/itsechomusic_/status/1572047690069843968), so do your research and make an informed decision based on the information you find. *Google, review sites, and similar are your best friends: use them.*
- **Know your worth.** If a company won't at least negotiate (read: compromise) for a fair price, it's best to walk away. I've done it many times that I've lost count. *If only you knew how much I've left on the table...*
- **If it seems sketchy, it probably is.** Trust your gut. If it seems off in any way, don't accept it. No, really.
- **Fair, flat rates only.** Don't do anything that relies on clicks or views for payment. That's not an ad, that's an affiliate scheme. Those are basically scams in 2022... run away.

Now, none of that is to say you *can't* join an affiliate program. But you shouldn't be asked in the guise of "this is a sponsorship." In my opinion, if you're joining an affiliate program, it's something *you* decide and aren't coerced into, something *you* believe in and not told to believe in. Working like this since 2019 has only given me the strength to take on sponsorships, or join the affiliate programs of things I care about. Everyone deserves that freedom.

I hope this post helps someone. That's the idea. Let me know if you have any questions, though.
